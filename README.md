                 <center><h4>The Hope Women's Service Center</h4></center>
                 <center><p>Hope Women’s Center has been around for thirty-eight years since its first women’s service facility opened up in Apache Junction as Arizona’s first crisis pregnancy center for women and teen girls. Hope owns around six facilities in the Arizona region and has seen many cases of intimate violence with mothers who raise 6 to 7 children alone. When these women first join the facility, some start out living in their vehicles trying to find resources of where to go and what to do. In some cases, women come out of trafficking hoping to find the resources they need to escape the harsh conditions they have been subjected to. The Hope Center takes serious precautions where they precede to lock down the building and contact law enforcement while they comfort the victim. Though the Hope Center is a faith-based organization, they open their doors to any women who require help. All services at Hope Women’s center are free under the 501 C3 non-profit organization receiving funds and resources from other companies as sponsors. Running on private donations as well as 97% of volunteer work in each facility. The Hope Women’s Center has provided its clients all around Arizona with a safe haven to get back on their feet.</p></center>

                     <center><h3>The current legislation on victims’ rights</h3></center>
                     <p>The current legislation on victims’ rights is stated under <i>article 2, section 2.1</i> of the Arizona Constitution which grants the rights of victims involved in a crime. Passed in 1990, the creation of <i>Arizona’s Victims’ Bill of Rights</i> leads to the legislation becoming implemented guaranteeing certain rights for victims of crime. This legislation makes sure that victims receive qualities such as justice, due process, fairness, and respect. This current legislation focuses on helping victims stay informed and making sure that victims’ voices and decisions are heard and respected.</p>
